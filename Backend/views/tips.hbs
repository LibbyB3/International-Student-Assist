                            <p>Moving from your home country to the US is exciting, but handling the various tasks
                                associated with relocating can be
                                stressful. In addition, once you arrive in the US and begin your studies, you may
                                experience many different feelings,
                                from culture shock to home sickness. Itâ€™s important to do what you can to minimize those
                                stressors and take care of your
                                mental health. Taking proper care of your mental health will contribute to your
                                enjoyment of your time in the US and
                                help ensure academic success. Here are a few suggestions to help you stay positive and
                                healthy:</p>
                            <p>1. Volunteer - Volunteering is an excellent way to contribute to the community, and
                                positive feelings often result from
                                giving back and forming new connections with others.
                            </p>
                            <p>2. Counseling services - The counseling services at your school can be an excellent way
                                to work through any difficult
                                feelings you might be having while studying in the US. Counselors can work with you to
                                find solutions to problems you
                                may be having. They can also direct you to other school resources that may be helpful.
                            </p>
                            <p>3. Meditation and prayer - Meditation and prayer can help create positive feelings,
                                relieve stress, and create perspective
                                as you face challenges during your studies.
                            </p>
                            <p>4. Take breaks and spend time outdoors - It is important to find time to unwind and give
                                yourself room to appreciate the
                                positive aspects of your new environment.
                            </p>
                            <p>5. Join clubs - Making connections with others in school clubs and organizations can
                                result in many positive experiences.
                                It can also help you experience a sense of community with others at your school.
                            </p>
                            <p>6. Keep a planner, attend class regularly, and make time to study - Staying organized can
                                help you avoid unnecessary stress
                                associated with missed deadlines and poor academic performance.

                            <p>It may be challenging to make the effort to form a community of people who can provide
                                you with support, but the effort
                                has a payoff of providing meaningful experiences and help during times of difficulty. A
                                few tips to build a system of
                                support include:
                            </p>
                            <p>1. Make friends with other students on campus, perhaps through Greek or service
                                organizations - Friends can create positive
                                experiences and provide opportunities to grow. Having friends can make you more
                                resilient as you encounter challenges at
                                school. Itâ€™s also great to have a group of people you can share your successes with.
                                Joining an organization with others
                                who share your interests is a great opportunity to network and create enriching
                                relationships.
                            </p>
                            <p>2. Attend counseling - Counselors can help you maintain your mental health while at
                                school.
                            </p>
                            <p>3. Make use of tutoring offered by your school - Tutors and other academic support at
                                your school can be a great help in
                                your journey through school.
                            </p>
                            <p>4. Stay connected to friends and family in your home country - Staying connected to home
                                can help you stay positive and can
                                stave off homesickness. Sharing your successes with family and those important to you
                                can also be a great source of
                                motivation.
                            </p>
                            <p>5. Develop relationships with professors - Professors are often willing to provide
                                assistance and helpful advice to
                                students who make the effort to reach out to them. They may also be able to inform you
                                of various opportunities
                                available to you at the school.
                            </p>
                            <p>6. Join international student organizations - It can often help to have other students

                                It is a good idea to tour your campus as soon as possible. This will help you become
                                familiar with the new environment
                                and allow you to feel more comfortable as you make your way to your classes in the first
                                few weeks of school.
                            </p>
                            <p>You should be familiar with your universityâ€™s grading policies and the grading systems of
                                each of your courses. This
                                will help you set appropriate academic goals and will prevent surprises caused by not
                                understanding university or
                                professor expectations.

                            <p>Finally, you should be aware if courses at your university are often impacted. Are there
                                more students who wish to
                                enroll in a course than there are available spaces? Whether this is the case or not, it
                                is always a good idea to enroll
                                in your courses as soon as possible to avoid disappointment, or worse, being delayed in
                                taking courses needed to
                                complete your academic program.
