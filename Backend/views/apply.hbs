                Once you have researched your candidate schools and narrowed down your list to the schools you wish to attend, it’s time
                to apply.
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 3.5vh">Admission Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                It’s important to look at each school and have a thorough understanding of the admission requirements of each one.
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 3.5vh">What is their application deadline?</h2>
            <p>
                First, make note of each school’s application deadline to be sure you submit the application on time. You’ll want to
                give yourself plenty of time to complete and review your applications, especially those for the schools you most want to
                attend.
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 3.5vh">Do you need letters of recommendation?</h2>
            <p>
                Don’t delay contacting instructors, mentors, and employers to request letters of recommendation. The more notice you
                give to these individuals, the more appreciative they will be and the more time they can spend crafting an excellent
                letter of recommendation for you.
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 3.5vh">Do you have to submit a writing sample, statement of purpose, or admission essay?</h2>
            <p>
                If an essay or writing sample is required, make sure to give yourself plenty of time to think about the writing prompt,
                create an outline, write your essay, edit it, and perhaps have it reviewed by another writer whose ability you trust. A
                compelling essay could make the difference between being declined for admission and getting into your school of choice.
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 3.5vh">Is an interview required?</h2>
            <p>
                It is important to know if the school you want to attend requires you to take part in an interview. If appointment dates
                aren’t automatically assigned, you’ll need to find out how to make a virtual or in-person appointment.
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 3.5vh">Reflect on your academic and professional career in order to craft a great story about yourself.</h2>
            <p>
                Often, completing admission applications requires you to gather information about yourself and highlight your most
                notable academic, professional and personal achievements. These include organizations and activities you’ve taken part
                in, professional positions you’ve held, awards you’ve won, service projects you’ve completed, and special skills and
                abilities you’ve acquired. Use this information to create an application profile or CV (short for curriculum vitae) that
                the admissions committees are wowed by.
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 3.5vh">Official transcripts, transcript evaluation, English proficiency, standardized tests, and all the rest.</h2>
            <p>
                Most US universities will require you to submit an official transcript that has been interpreted by a transcript
                evaluation company. They may also require you to complete a number of exams to demonstrate that you can be successful at
                that particular institution. These and other aspects of the admissions process are covered in the sections that follow.
