            <p>Although fewer and fewer universities are requiring students to take standardized tests like the SAT and ACT, many
                universities still require them.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 3.5vh">What are the ACT and SAT?</h2>
            <p>The ACT (American College Testing) and SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) are standardized exams that test students’
                knowledge of broad subjects like math, reading, writing, and scientific reasoning. You should definitely find out if
                your chosen US college or university requires one of these tests because you’ll want to begin studying for it as
                early as possible. For schools that require one of these tests, scores are factored into decisions to admit or deny
                students. In most cases, the higher your score, the better chance you have of being admitted to your chosen school.
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 3.5vh">Do I have to take the ACT or SAT?</h2>
            <p>In many cases, the answer is no. Many schools no longer require these standardized tests and for many others, taking
                the ACT or SAT is optional. However, if the school you want to go to states that the test is optional, keep in mind
                that a strong ACT or SAT score can strengthen your application.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 3.5vh">Where can I take the ACT or SAT?</h2>
            <p>The SAT is taken digitally and at some testing locations, it can be taken on the student’s own laptop. The test is
                taken in person at any one of the many international testing facilities that operate in partnership with the College
                Board, the organization that administers the SAT. You can find test dates and testing facilities here:

            <p>The ACT can be taken on paper or digitally. International students can sign up for the test here:
